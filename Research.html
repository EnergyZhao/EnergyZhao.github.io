  <h2>Far- and Near-field Thermal Radiation, Thermal Photonics, Plasmonics, Metamaterials, and 2D Materials</h2> 

  Micro/nanoscale thermal radiation is of great importance in advanced energy systems, nanomanufacturing, local thermal management, and near-field imaging. It concerns both electromagnetic wave interactions with micro/nanostructured materials that could potentially modify the far-field radiative properties and near-field radiative heat transfer between closely spaced objects. Plasmonic subwavelength nanostructures and metamaterials can exploit plasmons, a collective oscillation of charge carriers, to achieve wavelength-selective thermal radiation in the far-field. On the other hand, emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and black phosphorus (BP), offer new exciting elements to construct metamaterials with unique thermal radiative properties. My research explores the role of plasmonic nanostructures and metamaterials, as well as 2D materials, for their abilities to control far-field thermal radiation. Specific emphasis is placed on the plentiful coupling effects between graphene and hBN with plasmonic nanostructures and the unique far-field radiative properties induced by the coupling. Meanwhile, I research the near-field heat transfer and enhanced photon tunneling between 2D materials (including their heterostructures), periodic micro/nanostructures, and metamaterials. My major published works are listed below.

    <h3> 
      Strong Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer between Doped-Si Parallel Plates
    </h3>

    <p>
      Heat transfer between two objects separated by a nanoscale vacuum gap holds great promise especially in energy harvesting applications such as near-field thermophotovoltaic systems. However, experimental validation of nanoscale radiative heat transfer has been largely limited to tip-plate configurations due to challenges of maintaining small gap spacing over a relatively large area. Here, we report measurements of heat transfer near room temperature between two 1 cm by 1 cm doped-Si parallel plates, separated by a vacuum gap from 200 nm to 782 nm. The measured strong near-field radiative transfer is in quantitative agreement with the theoretical prediction based on fluctuational electrodynamics. The largest measured radiative heat flux is 11 times as high as the blackbody limit for the same hot and cold surface temperatures. Our experiments have produced the highest radiative heat transfer rate observed to date across submicron distances between objects near room temperature. <a href="pdf/APL NF Mea.pdf"><b>Related Paper</b></a>

      Thermophotovoltaic emitters based on a two-dimensional grating/thin-film nanostructure
    </h3>

    <p>
      Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) devices can convert thermal radiation directly into electricity. To improve the efficiency of TPV systems, wavelength-selective emitters are designed to take thermal energy from various heat sources and then emit photons to the TPV cells. This work proposes a two-dimensional grating/thin-film nanostructure as an efficient emitter, whose performance is enhanced by the excitations of both surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and magnetic polaritons (MPs). The normal emittance of the proposed nanostructure is shown to be wavelength-selective and polarization-insensitive. The mechanisms of SPP and MP excitations in the nanostructure are elucidated for different polarizations. The effect of azimuthal and polar angles on the emittance spectra suggests that the proposed structure has high emittance not only in the normal direction but also at large oblique angles.<a href="pdf/Zhao et al. 2013 IJHMT 2D TPV.pdf"><b>Related Paper</b></a>

      Magnetic Polaritons in Deep Metallic Gratings
    </h3>

    <p>
      This work reveals the fundamental mechanism for the resonances in deep gratings by considering the excitation of magnetic polaritons (MPs). It is shown that MPs and cavity modes agree with each other when the kinetic inductance is negligibly small. However, when the kinetic inductance is sufficiently large, the maximum resonance wavelength can be more than twice that predicted by the cavity mode. Different materials are considered and the frequency range is extended from the near-infrared to the microwave region to illustrate the scalability of the MPs. This study clarifies one of the underlying mechanisms of optical resonance in deep gratings and can benefit the design of wavelength-selective thermal emitters. <a href="pdf/Zhao-Zhang 2014 JQSRT.pdf"><b>Related Paper</b></a>

      Enhanced absorption in graphene with metal gratings
    </h3>

    <p>
      Graphene has been demonstrated as a good candidate for ultrafast optoelectronic devices. However, graphene is essentially transparent in the visible and near infrared with an absorptivity of 2.3%, which has largely limited its application in photon detection. This work demonstrates that the absorptance in a monatomic graphene layer can be greatly enhanced to nearly 70%, thanks to the localized strong electric field resulting from magnetic resonances in deep metal gratings. Furthermore, the resonance frequency is essentially not affected by the additional graphene layer. This method may benefit the design of next-generation graphene-based optical and optoelectronic devices.<a href="pdf/Zhao et al 2014 APL.pdf"><b>Related Paper</b></a>

    <h3>
      Strong Plasmonic Coupling between Graphene Ribbon Array and Metal Gratings
    </h3>

    <p>
      The collective oscillation of the massless electrons in graphene ribbons can interact with photons to create graphene plasmon polaritons. The resonance-induced absorption is critical in signal detection and energy harvesting applications. However, because of their atomic thickness, high absorptance is difficult to achieve with graphene ribbons alone. In this work, a hybrid plasmonic system composed of an array of graphene ribbons over a periodic metal grating is theoretically investigated. It is shown that the localized resonances, i.e., magnetic polaritons, in metal gratings can couple with the plasmonic resonance in graphene ribbons, resulting in significantly enhanced absorption in graphene. Moreover, the coupling phenomenon depends on the width of the ribbons and the relative positions of the ribbon and the grating. The coupling between the grating and a continuous graphene monolayer sheet is also investigated and the results are compared to those with graphene ribbons. The findings of this work may facilitate the design of optoelectronic devices and metamaterials structures based on hybrid nanostructures and graphene.<a href="pdf/Zhao&Zhang 2015 ACS Photonics.pdf"><b>Related Paper</b></a>

      Enhanced Photon Tunneling by Surface Plasmon-Phonon Polaritons in Graphene/hBN Heterostructures
    </h3>

    <p>
      Enhancing photon tunneling probability is the key to increasing the near-field radiative heat transfer between two objects. It has been shown that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene heterostructures can enable plentiful phononic and plasmonic resonance modes. This work demonstrates that heterostructures consisting of a monolayer graphene on a hBN film can support surface plasmon-phonon polaritons that greatly enhance the photon tunneling and outperform individual structures made of either graphene or hBN. Both the thickness of the hBN films and the chemical potential of graphene can affect the tunneling probability, offering potential routes toward passive or active control of near-field heat transfer. The results presented here may facilitate the system design for near-field energy harvesting, thermal imaging, and radiative cooling applications based on two-dimensional materials.<a href="pdf/Zhao&Zhang JHT 2016.pdf"><b>Related Paper</b></a>

      Perfect mid-infrared absorption by hybrid phonon-plasmon polaritons in hBN/metal grating anisotropic structures
    </h3>

    <p>
      The ability to support low-loss hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPP) by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) films has attractive potentials for achieving perfect absorption and wavelength-selective emission for high-temperature applications. A nanostructure based on periodic metal gratings and hBN films is proposed here. As a phononic two-dimensional (2D) material, hBN has two mid-infrared Reststrahlen bands with natural hyperbolic responses. Magnetic polaritons (MP) in metal gratings can couple with HPPs in hBN to create hybrid hyperbolic phonon-plasmon polaritons, resulting in perfect or near-perfect absorption. It is found that the majority of the power absorbed by the hybrid polaritons is dissipated in the hBN film with a unique tunable location-dependent absorption profile. Meanwhile, in the frequency range where hBN does not support HPPs, optical phonons in hBN can still couple with MPs in gratings to yield resonance absorption. The effect of geometric parameters is analyzed to elucidate the mechanisms of the perfect and near-perfect absorption. The radiative properties and dissipation profiles are calculated based on rigorous coupled-wave analysis, which has been extended to include anisotropic materials. This work reveals the promising potential of using 2D materials and nanostructures to achieve unique radiative properties. The results from this work may benefit applications such as energy harvesting, radiative cooling, and photodetection.<a href="pdf/Zhao and Zhang IJHMT 2016.pdf"><b>Related Paper</b></a>
